# rodentRepellent
The aim of this part of the project is to actually identify that a rodent is present in the given environment. Our idea consists of a three-step process to minimize false positives in the identification of rodents. For our first check, we would use ultrasonic sound emitters and receivers to bounce sound waves off an object to track its distance relative to the device and its speed. Next would use a thermal camera to check if an object has a thermal signature. Finally, we would use the distance acquired in step one and the image gathered from the thermal camera to calculate the size of the object. The first step will eliminate objects that are stationary, the second step will eliminate objects that do not have a specific heat signature, and the third step will make sure that the object is the correct size.
